# Artificial Intelligence for Aerospace Engineers

## Lecture 1 (Introduction)

- Machines are great at finding correlations; but bad **interpretability** and **robustness** to data
- Humans are good at finding principles; don't forget about the causes/approaches available when solving problems!

Admin:
- 17h lectures, 2h computing, 5h computing tutorials
- 70% final exam, 30% weekly assignments (need to pass 4/6 minimum; pass fail 3 attempts autograder)
- MCQ, 1.5h, theory and good practice (no coding exercises); weekly quizzes designed similarly

Definitions:
- Artificial intelligence: study and design of intelligent agents
- Machine learning: tool that can use data (inputs) to give a prediction (outputs)
- Data science and data mining: statistical inference, data visualization, communication; extract knowledge from data
- Deep learning: multilayered NNs learn from vast amounts of data

Why AI in Aerospace Engineering:
- Vast and increasing data
- Advances in HPC (Moore's law)
- Improvements to sensing technologies, data storage and transfer
- Scalable algorithms from statistics and applied mathematics
- Considerably investment by industry, leading to an abundance of open source software
- Digital thread and digital twin: digitalization every stage of design/manufacture of product, collect data at every stage (digital thread), very accurate model of product (digital twin)

Types of AI Algorithms:
- Supervised learning: describe features and labels for data (e.g. regression)
- Unsupervised learning: describe data, algorithm to cluster data according to some similarity (define its own features to separate data into classes)
- Semi-supervised learning: inbetween, such as **reinforcement learning**
